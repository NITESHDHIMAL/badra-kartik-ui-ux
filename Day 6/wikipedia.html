                <h2>Ancient Nepal</h2>
                <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where they had earlier evolved.[31][32][33] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
                    date to about 30,000 years ago.[34] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
                    settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[35]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[36] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[37][36] the first
                    urban culture in South Asia.[38] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
                    have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[39] The earliest inhabitants of modern
                    Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is
                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[40] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[41] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[42]


                    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in Nepal
                    since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
                    By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[43] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[44] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[45] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra.</p>
